    <h1>I'm Sorry</h1>

    <h2>What I Did</h2>
    <p>
      I disturbed you a lot through the multitude of texts I sent to you. Infact kuch kuch messages bohat hi illogical tha, and I am pretty sure you must have been irritated a lot. I should've known better, and I'm sorry.
    </p>

    <h2>Why That Wasn't Okay</h2>
    <p>
      I disturbed you unnecessarily - random times pe random messages karke + randomly bohat haphazardly meet krne ko bhi bola tha. Ajj observe kia ki like - You were already dealing with your own stuff, and instead of giving you space, I added more noise. 
      </p>
      <p>I was thinking about what I wanted—to talk to you, to see you—without considering what you actually needed at that moment. Every time you saw my message, it probably came with an expectation to respond, and you shouldn't have felt obligated like that. If I had actually paid attention to you, I would've noticed you weren't in the headspace for all this, but I was too caught up in my own stuff. I wasn't being considerate, and that was selfish.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Should've Done</h2>
    <p>
      Mujhe aur bhi mature hona chahiye tha. I should've thought about what you needed instead of just doing what I felt like. You deserve that respect.
    </p>

    <h2>Going Forward</h2>
    <p>
      I won't disturb you like that again. You have my word.
    </p>
